# javafx-date-time-picker
A date time picker for javafx. JavaFX(openFX) have a DatePicker for pick a date. But here isn't a time picker.

2. control-fx: no time picker. Date picker only display time info
3. edvin/tornadofx-controls: Date picker only display time data, no slide or spin or any input UI.
4. JFXtras: no second picker
